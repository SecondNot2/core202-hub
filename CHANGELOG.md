# CHANGELOG

## [2026-01-16]

### Added

- **GitHub Integration**: New `GitHubWidget` on Dashboard with real-time stats and contribution calendar.
- **Extended Analytics**: Active hour heatmaps and recent commit history.
- **Light Mode Redesign**: Comprehensive support for Light Mode across all RPG pages (Dashboard, Character, Skill Tree, Boss, Crafting).

### Fixed

- **Build Errors**: Resolved multiple syntax issues related to duplicate return statements in `Dashboard.tsx`, `HeroPanel.tsx`, `CraftingPanel.tsx`, and `NoBoss.tsx`.
- **UI Consistency**: Fixed hardcoded dark styles that were breaking visibility in light mode.
